*I don't like leaves,I like stone.*

*leaves gone when winds up , but stone not.*

*leaves rotten when tide waves , but stone not.*

*leaves burning when temp rising , but stone not.*

*so pity*

*I changed my plan when clock alarming at 6:30,*

*I changed my plan when I'm hungry or tired,*

*I changed my plan when I see preety girls.*

*so ,  pitttty*

*I'm a leaf, but I like stone.*
